      Your Beacon chain node must have access to a syncronized xDai mainnet node. 
      If you have not already, make sure to install and sync an xDai node of your choice ([Install Nethermind Gnosis](http://my.dappnode/#/installer/nethermind-xdai.dnp.dappnode.eth)) and use its RPC url
      Or use the official RPC endpoint: **https://rpc.gnosischain.com**

    description: >-
      To get Teku up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Teku from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync.
      Get your checkpoint sync from a synced and running Gnosis Beacon Chain node or use the official checkpoint sync endpoint: **https://rpc-gbc.gnosischain.com**
