      Your Beacon chain node must have access to a syncronized gnosis chain node. 
      If you have not already, make sure to install and sync a gnosis node of your choice.
      Then, input the URL of the node that you wish to use or a remote one:
      For example: https://rpc.xdaichain.com/

    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Teku up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Teku from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Check [Teku docs](https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/HowTo/Get-Started/Checkpoint-Start/)
      Get your checkpoint sync from a running gnosis node or use the official one **https://rpc.xdaichain.com/**
